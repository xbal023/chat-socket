# *Chat Socket Website*

## ðŸš€ *Getting Started*

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm xbal023, and I'm super excited to introduce you to my new project - a chat socket website! This project is still in its infancy, but I'm thrilled to share it with you.

## *What's Coming Up?*

In this project, we'll be building a chat socket website with the following features:

1. *Login Page*: Where you can sign in and access the chat dashboard.
2. *Register Page*: Where you can create a new account and join the chat party!
3. *Chat Dashboard*: Where the magic happens! You'll be able to chat with other users in real-time. ðŸ“±

## *Project Status*

We're just getting started, and this project is still in its early stages. But don't worry, I'll be working hard to bring it to life! ðŸ’ª Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute or provide feedback.

## *Let's Chat!*

If you have any questions or want to get involved, hit me up! I'd love to chat with you about this project. ðŸ’¬

That's it for now! Thanks for stopping by, and I'll see you on the flip side!
